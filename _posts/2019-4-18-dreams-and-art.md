title: Dreams and Art
---

Note: Despite the positive sounding title, this is kind of a venting post. Also a continuation of the last one, but you
don't really need to read that? Maybe don't read that one.

So, for the past two years at least, my dreams have had a few frustrating common genres. First off, were the
dreams where I was in a car- I could never actually drive the car, only ride in it, and the roads were twisted about as much
as your standard Mario Kart level. It was not a good time.

The other kinds of dreams were the self sabotaging ones, where I'd have some kind of superpower, but it was just nerfed
into oblivion, to the point of being completely useless, or with enough restrictions to be actively counterproductive, and 
then the ones that were just utterly, horribly boring, almost exactly like the most dull parts of everyday life.

It's almost like there's a common theme of futility, lack of agency, and inability to control life.

That's also been changing. The road dreams ended when I opened the door and got out of the car when it was stopped,
and lately, my dreams have had a single focus: actually driving. If dreams are related to learning, then this is
probably a good thing, but there are a few things I could live without, like the dream from two nights ago. 

I was driving a car with an instructor. Said instructor had the body of a six or maybe eight year old, the face of an old guy,
and... he left because he had other things to do, leaving me on the road in charge of the vehicle alone.

I was irritated by this, but I made it home (even though it was illegal to drive on my own, which I was aware of, because 
what else was I supposed to do with no phone), only to wind up seeing the guy again in the grocery store. I picked him up
by his wispy baby hair and gave him a stern chewing out, which was honestly pretty enjoyable.

Needless to say, I would not recommend Tiny Baby Man Driving School to my friends, family, or coworkers. If you are in search
of a driving instructor, find one without the tiny itty bitty hands, legs, and stickiness of a young child.



And now, art. No value judgements are intended by the following text, it's mostly venting.


A few days ago, I made a (brief) attempt at engaging in that great american tradition of appropriating things that aren't your 
own and altering them to your liking, fanfiction. By the time I had altered my first paragraph (then two paragraphs) a dozen
times, I had come to a conclusion:

Out of all the art forms in the world, writing is the **worst**.

Maybe it's because I always feel like I'm writing either like a pretentious jerk or a fifth grader in the long form, but
really?

When you're doing pixel art, or 3d modeling, or even drawing, you can tell what you're trying to do; look at the 
lines you've written, judge the lengths, the silhouette, the proportion, and design, and aim for something that looks right,
with writing, you... can't.

It's completely open. When you have an open document in front of you, anything can go there- there are nearly infinite varieties 
of styles, moods, feelings, and so many different ways to say the same thing. It's frustrating. If I'm in the player's, or even
the GM's seat at a tabletop RPG, it's fine, and I can happily wax about my character's majestic hair or their lost opportunities
for a regular life working in an office building so very much like the one they're stealing all the coffee mugs out of, but doing
everything is an all new nightmare, and... I just don't like it.

Working on my tabletop RPG things is another matter entirely, and I want to get back into that in the next while.

But right now, I've got Unity Personal Edition installed, and I look forward to trying to figure out what I can do with it. 
Hopefully, trying to learn how to use it won't be a colossal waste of time, but with the cross-applicability of most
new skills, it probably won't be.

And maybe after writing out some blog posts, my writing style will stabilize a bit and I'll hate writing fiction less. Probably not though.




UPDATE: Since I slept a grand total of 3-4 hours last night, I spent the entire day playing Star Wars: KOTOR. Good times, finally made it off Taris.
