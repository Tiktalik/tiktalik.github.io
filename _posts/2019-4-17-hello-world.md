Or: Sometimes you can't think of a good title, so you just use the most formulaic one possible.

I'm going to be real here. I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time. Jekyll, like most forms of web development is an absolute enigma to me, but given that there seem to be posts showing up now, I'm probably on the right track.

Anyway, on the off chance you don't know me, I'm Tiktalik/potato. I'm not going to get into personal information here,
because this is more or less for myself, not every random person that comes along and I'm mildly paranoid about my privacy, hence,
you know, github, and not Tumblr or Blogspot.

I had meant to get this up about half the month or so ago, but after a few failed tries because I didn't do the correct thing and
actually *look up how to fix the problem I was having on google*, it ended up waiting.

Then it took all of ten minutes to set up when I did that. Moral of the story for future me, use the Vast Knowledge Engine.

In that past while, my life's been unusually busy! I'm finally making progress on becoming able to drive, I've hit 999 multiple
times in Tetris: The Grand Master, and there's been Risk of Rain 2, which ate my life for a few days, attempted to write a fanfic
a few times and came to a solid conclusion about that activity.

I don't like it.

But it's late, so this is where this post stops. Tomorrow's post will be about art, dreams, and why I can't stand fiction writing.
